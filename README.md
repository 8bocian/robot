# 4-Axis Robotic Arm Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a 4-axis robotic arm that I built using aluminum profiles, servo-motors, wood, and Raspberry Pi. This project showcases my passion for engineering, programming, and creative problem-solving.

## Features

- Four-axis movement: The robotic arm can move in four directions, providing flexibility and versatility in its operations.
- Raspberry Pi control: The arm is controlled by a Raspberry Pi, enabling seamless integration with other devices and potential automation.
- Independent math calculations: The mathematical calculations for the arm's movement were done independently, showcasing my problem-solving skills and technical expertise.
- Sturdy construction: The arm is built using durable aluminum profiles and wood, ensuring stability and longevity.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need the following:

- Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS installed
- Servo-motors
- Aluminum profiles
- Wood
- Basic tools for assembly (screws, screwdrivers, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Connect the servo-motors to the Raspberry Pi according to the provided pin mapping.
3. Assemble the robotic arm using the provided instructions in the `AssemblyGuide.pdf` file.
4. Power up the Raspberry Pi and run the `robotic_arm_control.py` script.

## Usage

Once you have the robotic arm set up and the code running, you can control its movement using your mouse and keyboard connected to the rpi.
Feel free to modify the code to add more functionality or enhance the arm's capabilities based on your requirements.
